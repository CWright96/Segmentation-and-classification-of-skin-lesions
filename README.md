# Segmentation-and-classification-of-skin-lesions
Machine learning approach to skin lesion segmentation and classidication for EEE6230 project 3
This code was created by Sai Krishnan and Chris Wright for EEE6230 project 3.
We use a deep learning appraoch to tacking the problem of skin lesion classification and segmentation.
Training data can be gathered from https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/n/ISIC_2017%3A_Skin_Lesion_Analysis_Towards_Melanoma_Detection.
The trained networks are too large to be pushed to github so they can be made availiabele on request.
The code used to train and test each network is in classnet.m and segnet.m
More detailed breakdowns of the code can be found in the specific read me files.
